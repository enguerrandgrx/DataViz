# Peer assessment


First of all its not the first project have together so we communicate very well, which is probably the most important aspect of teamwork. 

We conducted once or twice a week meetings, and at the end of each meeting we have a well defined objective for the next one. 

We also will separate our work, but always can help each other in case of needed. 

We work with github and try as as much as possible to comment our commit in order for the other one to know exaclty where we are in our works. 

Finally, we always try to discuss about implementation and ideas for the most interesting data we can find for our Project.
